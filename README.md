# Emotion Detection using Static Images

This project focuses on emotion detection using static images. It utilizes machine learning techniques, Python, Keras, and other relevant libraries to classify the emotions depicted in images.

## Features

- **Emotion Classification**: The project aims to accurately classify emotions in static images. It analyzes facial expressions to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, etc.

- **Image Processing**: The project employs image processing techniques to preprocess the input images, extract relevant features, and prepare them for emotion classification.

- **Machine Learning**: Machine learning models, implemented using the Keras library, are trained on labeled image datasets to recognize and classify emotions accurately.

- **Web Application**: The project includes a web application that allows users to upload images and receive real-time emotion predictions for the uploaded images.

## Tech Stack

The Emotion Detection project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing the image processing, machine learning, and web application components.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks library that simplifies the process of building, training, and deploying deep learning models.
- **Machine Learning**: Various machine learning algorithms and techniques are employed, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to train emotion classification models.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to develop the web application for uploading images and predicting emotions.

## Getting Started

To run the Emotion Detection project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/araczzz/Emotion-detection-webApp-.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the web application**:

   Run the following command to start the Flask development server:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

   The web application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

4. **Upload and predict emotions**:

   Open the web application in your browser and upload static images that depict human faces. The application will analyze the uploaded images and provide real-time predictions for the emotions detected.
